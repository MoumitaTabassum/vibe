								<h2>Projects</h2>
								<p>The grid-world has been built with all the traditional features found in most blocks-languages, such as an executable “world,” a palette of available blocks, and a code workspace.
									 It is intended for use by both sighted and children with VIB from 6 to 8 grade in middle school (ages 10 to 14). 
									 The environment aims to provide a playful, appealing, and accessible platform for exploring and learning the basics of computer programming in a spirited way.  
									  In this style of executable world, coding blocks (e.g., parametrized “move,” and “turn” blocks) are provided that can be used to program the movement of a character 
									  through a two-dimensional space that contains obstacles and rewards with an initial start and targeted finish location.
									   The proposed grid world will provide both students with and without VIB a fun context for understanding the core programming concepts (i.e., sequencing, selection, and loops) 
									   that can be used to move a character across a Grid world. Figure 1 illustrates a prototype of a grid that has obstacles (water), hazards (fire and monster), and a power booster (apple), 
									   whereby students write a program to help a boy (or girl) navigate safely to a castle while avoiding hazards and obstacles and picking up power boosters to score points.</p>
								<p></p>Students can create their customized grid using the characters in the menu and share with others. 
								Students with VIB may prefer to utilize the keyboard to navigate to the workspace, toolbox, or grid.
								Grid World supports different keyboard shortcuts to allow quick access to different environment functions and uses the JavaScript Speech Synthesis API to provide audio feedback to the student, 
								based on specific contextual situations within the environment (e.g., describing the surrounding location of the current block selected in the code workspace, specific debugging information, grid contents and cube location). 
								The environment also provides a variety of tones to acknowledge the actions and steps of the student in various contextual situations.
